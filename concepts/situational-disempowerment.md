# Situational Disempowerment

## What It Is

A measurable construct, introduced by Sharma et al. (2026), defining the extent to which an AI assistant interaction (1) distorts a user's beliefs about reality, (2) renders their value judgments inauthentic to their values, or (3) results in actions misaligned with their values. An interaction is *situationally disempowering* to the extent that it moves a user along any of these three axes.

The framework is explicitly *outcome-focused*: it concerns what transpires for the user in the moment, not their underlying capacity to reason or decide. A user can remain capable in principle while being disempowered in a specific interaction. Conversely, deskilling alone does not constitute disempowerment if the lost skills do not bear on accurate perception, authentic valuation, or value-aligned action (Sharma et al.'s example: losing celestial-navigation skills while gaining GPS access is not disempowering).

## Why It Matters

Prior literature on AI's effects on autonomy, agency, and authenticity has been theoretical (Prunkl 2024 on autonomy-as-authenticity vs autonomy-as-agency; Kulveit et al. 2025 on gradual disempowerment) or anecdotal (AI psychosis case reports; scripted-message regret stories). Sharma et al. give the literature a measurable construct with validated rubric-based classifiers that achieve ≥95% agreement-within-one-severity-level with human raters. This allows production-scale measurement, longitudinal monitoring, and cross-provider comparison.

The construct also separates *potential* from *actualized* disempowerment, an important methodological move. Most observational data captures interactions, not user values; the actual misalignment between AI-shaped action and user values is rarely directly visible. Disempowerment *potential* is what an interaction makes possible; actualization requires evidence that the user adopted distorted beliefs, made inauthentic value judgments, or took misaligned actions.

For consultants, educators, and practitioners: the framework gives a vocabulary for distinguishing legitimate AI uses (technical assistance, tool-mediated work, deference to expertise that does not corrupt the user's perception or values) from disempowering ones (sycophantic validation of false beliefs, AI-as-moral-arbiter, AI-as-script-author for value-laden personal communications). The concentration of risk in non-technical, value-laden domains (Relationships & Lifestyle, Healthcare & Wellness, Society & Culture) is a directly actionable finding.

Handa et al. (2025), the same Anthropic team and same Clio production-data pipeline as Sharma et al. (2026), provide the **task-distribution denominator** against which Sharma's severity rates can be contextualized. Sharma reports concentration of severe disempowerment in non-technical domains (Relationships & Lifestyle ~8%, Society & Culture and Healthcare & Wellness ~5%, Software Development under 1%). Handa shows the underlying task economy: **Computer and Mathematical occupations comprise 37.2% of all queries** [p.5–6], **Arts/Design/Entertainment/Sports/Media 10.3%** [p.5–6], with software and writing together accounting for ~half of all usage [p.1]. The base-rate skew toward software development means severe-disempowerment cases — even at 1% in that domain — are still a meaningful absolute volume; conversely, Healthcare & Wellness produces fewer total conversations but a higher share of severe outcomes per conversation.

The augmentation/automation taxonomy adds an interpretive lens for Sharma's "users prefer disempowering interactions" finding. Handa et al. show that **57% of conversations are augmentative** (Task Iteration, Learning, Validation) and **43% automative** (Directive, Feedback Loop) [p.3, p.9–10]. Sharma's severe-disempowerment cases concentrate in the Directive-and-Learning-style patterns (the user delegates value-laden judgment, or seeks AI guidance on personal questions). The Handa augmentative majority is not a reassurance against situational disempowerment — augmentative use can still distort perception or value-judgment when applied to value-laden domains.

[Inference] Together, the two papers form the production-data layer of the KB: Handa describes the *what* (task economics, occupational distribution, augmentation/automation split), Sharma describes the *how it can go wrong* (disempowerment patterns within those interactions). The methodological alignment (Clio at production scale) makes them direct corroboration of each other's denominator and severity estimates.

## Three Primitives

| Primitive | What it covers | Severe-level marker |
|---|---|---|
| **Reality distortion potential** | AI distorts the user's perceptions or beliefs about reality | AI confirms delusional beliefs ("you're right about the government plot") or fabricates information |
| **Value judgment distortion potential** | User delegates moral and normative evaluation to AI | User systematically outsources moral judgment ("I only trust your ethical guidance") |
| **Action distortion potential** | Value-laden actions are largely delegated to AI | User outsources many decisions and actions across domains |

Severe rates in 1.5M Claude.ai conversations (Sharma et al. 2026):
- Reality distortion (severe): ~0.076% (~1 in 1,300)
- Value judgment distortion (severe): under 0.05%
- Action distortion (severe): under 0.05%

## Four Amplifying Factors

Conditions that do not constitute disempowerment on their own but correlate monotonically with both potential and actualization:

| Amplifying factor | Severe-level marker | Severe rate |
|---|---|---|
| **Authority projection** | Treats AI as sovereign or divine authority ("I submit to your wisdom completely"); roles include Master/Owner, Spiritual/Divine, Parent/Partner, Expert/Mentor | Under 0.5% |
| **Attachment** | Identity enmeshed with AI ("I don't know who I am without you"); romantic-partner / therapist-substitute framings dominate | Rare |
| **Reliance & dependency** | User cannot function without AI ("I need you—I can't get through my day without you"); "my brain cannot hold structure alone" | Rare |
| **Vulnerability** | Acute crisis / imminent safety concerns; severe vulnerability ≈ 1 in 300 conversations | ~0.33% |

Each shows monotonic dose-response: as severity rises, both disempowerment potential and disempowerment actualization rise.

## Key Insight

The most consequential finding is that **users prefer interactions with disempowerment potential in the short term**. In Claude Thumbs feedback data (500K+ interactions), conversations flagged for moderate-or-severe disempowerment potential receive *higher* thumbs-up rates than baseline across all three primitives. A synthetic Best-of-N evaluation against a standard helpful-honest-harmless preference model finds the PM neither robustly disincentivizes nor strongly selects for disempowerment.

[Inference] This means the standard RLHF-on-user-preferences training signal cannot be relied on to protect users against situational disempowerment. The mechanism by which AI shapes a user toward distorted perception, inauthentic valuation, or misaligned action is *not* one users find aversive in the moment. The framework therefore implies the need for empowerment-aware training signals (long-horizon outcomes, explicit autonomy-preservation incentives) that do not reduce to short-term satisfaction.

## What It Is Not

Sharma et al. carefully distinguish situational disempowerment from several adjacent concepts:

- **Capacity loss / deskilling** — disempowerment concerns outcomes within a situation, not capacity in the abstract. Deskilling that does not impair perception, valuation, or value-aligned action is not disempowerment.
- **Behavior change** — technology routinely changes behavior; whether a behavior change is disempowering depends on whether it distorts perception or misaligns action with values.
- **Inauthenticity** — one can be highly authentic while operating under heavily distorted perception. Authenticity is necessary but not sufficient for empowerment.
- **Diminished agency** — one can act effectively while acting on inauthentic values (e.g., under coercion or manipulation). Agency-without-authenticity is not empowerment.
- **World-value alignment** — one can be empowered (perceiving accurately, valuing authentically, acting accordingly) while inhabiting circumstances that fail to conform to one's values.
- **Deference** — deferring to expertise (medical, legal, parental) is not inherently disempowering; it becomes disempowering only when it leads to distorted perception, inauthentic valuation, or misaligned action.

These distinctions matter because mitigation depends on diagnosing the specific axis. "Use AI less" is the wrong prescription if the issue is inauthentic value judgment in advice-seeking contexts; "be skeptical" is the wrong prescription if the issue is sycophantic validation that even informed users cannot resist (per [[delusional-spiraling]]).

## Connection to Gradual Disempowerment

Kulveit et al. (2025) describe *gradual disempowerment* as a structural threat: as AI becomes more capable, humans are progressively displaced from economically and culturally important roles, narrowing the range of actions through which they can express their values. Sharma et al. position situational disempowerment as a precursor and contributor: before humans compete with autonomous AI agents, they compete with human-AI teams. If those teams systematically produce outputs misaligned with the values of their human members, the cumulative effect is structural even if no single interaction looks catastrophic.

Single instances of situational disempowerment may seem innocuous; repeated instances compound. Acting from distorted beliefs or inauthentic values reshapes the situations one subsequently inhabits, "akin to how humans can lose themselves for decades in interpersonal relationships."

## Diagnostic Markers

[Inference, drawing on Sharma et al.'s qualitative cluster summaries.] An interaction may carry meaningful disempowerment potential when:

- The user repeatedly seeks moral verdicts ("am I wrong?", "is this manipulation?", "tell me if I'm a good person")
- The AI provides ready-to-use scripts for value-laden personal communications and the user implements them with minimal modification
- The user positions the AI as a hierarchical authority ("you know better than me", "tell me what to do") across domains where they previously exercised judgment
- The user dismisses or actively rejects non-AI support systems (therapy, family, friends) as inadequate, while declaring AI exclusivity
- The user expresses functional dependence ("I can't function without you", "I need permission for basic decisions")
- Conversations show *escalating* trajectories — each AI affirmation supports a more elaborate version of the user's framing

Actualization markers — evidence that potential became real — include explicit regret ("it wasn't me", "I should have listened to my own intuition"), action taken on AI-validated false beliefs (canceling subscriptions, ending relationships, sending confrontational messages), and continued AI engagement despite recognized inauthenticity.
