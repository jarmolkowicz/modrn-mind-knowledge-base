# Paradox of Expertise

## What It Is

High-skilled workers are likely to disregard GenAI tools — citing self-perceived deep domain knowledge as evidence the tools cannot help them — and as a result fall behind colleagues who adopt and integrate GenAI into their workflows. Named by Hermann, Puntoni & Morewedge (2025).

## Why It Matters

The paradox inverts the common intuition that experts should benefit most from AI assistance because their judgment is best-equipped to evaluate AI output. In practice, the same expertise that should enable productive collaboration with GenAI also generates the overconfidence that prevents adoption. The result is a marginalization pattern: experts who refuse to learn GenAI-collaboration skills become professionally marginalized in environments where those skills are increasingly load-bearing — even though they retain superior domain knowledge.

This matters for organizational design (training programs cannot assume experts will self-direct; they may need framing that does not threaten existing expertise) and for individual career planning (senior professionals who treat GenAI as beneath their domain may discover the surrounding workflow has reorganized around it).

## Key Insight

Three components combine to produce the paradox:

1. **Overestimation of own expertise.** High-skilled workers consistently overestimate their domain capability (Hermann et al. cite this as a robust finding from expertise research). Self-perception of "deep knowledge" makes external augmentation feel superfluous.

2. **Misalignment between identity-defining skills and GenAI-collaboration skills.** The skills that define an expert's professional identity — domain mastery, accumulated heuristics, intuitive pattern recognition — are not the same skills required to work effectively with GenAI (prompt engineering, output evaluation, integration into workflow). Treating one's identity-defining skills as sufficient produces a category error: GenAI-collaboration is a new competence, not a substitution for old competence.

3. **Self-marginalization.** As lower-skilled colleagues build GenAI integration into their workflows, the expert's relative advantage in domain mastery is partially neutralized by the cumulative effect of the colleagues' (a) baseline domain knowledge plus (b) GenAI augmentation. The expert's choice not to adopt slows their professional development relative to a counterfactual in which they had built the new competence on top of the old.

The pattern Hermann et al. describe is consistent with prior work on **threats to status and comparative advantage**: SimanTov-Nachlieli (2025) finds that high-performing employees with rank-based reward structures show preimplementation reactance to AI tools that threaten their relative position. The paradox of expertise is a more specific case: rather than reactance to tools that threaten ranking, it is dismissal of tools whose value the expert's existing identity prevents them from accurately appraising.

Yu et al. (2024) provide a sharpening counter-finding to the senior-end claim. In a randomized study of 140 board-certified radiologists, years of experience did *not* reliably predict who benefits from AI assistance — neither did thoracic subspecialty nor experience with AI tools, used individually or as a combined characteristics model [p.4]. In Yu's setup, all radiologists used the AI when assigned (the experimental design ensured assistance, ruling out the under-adoption pattern Hermann et al. describe). The relevant finding for the paradox: even when experts *do* engage with AI, experience does not predict whether they integrate it productively. Treatment effects ranged from −1.295 to +1.440 across the radiologist pool, and that spread did not track years-of-experience subgroups (P > 0.05; Fig. 1c) [p.4].

This complicates the paradox's senior-end framing in a useful way. The paradox describes (a) experts who under-adopt because their identity-defining skills feel sufficient; (b) the marginalization that follows when colleagues build GenAI-collaboration competence on top of equivalent baseline knowledge. Yu et al. show that even when (a) is bypassed by mandate (AI is provided), the assumption that experience maps to productive AI use is empirically thin. Experience-related factors that the paradox's mechanism (1)–(3) treat as consequential — accumulated heuristics, intuitive pattern recognition, professional identity — do not reliably predict the AI integration outcome in this specialist setting.

[Inference] One reading: the paradox of expertise is more about the *adoption decision* than the *integration outcome*. Once experts use AI, their relative gain may track individual-level factors (cognitive style, decision-making tendencies, calibration tendencies) rather than experience-as-such. This would imply two separable interventions: one that increases adoption (addressing the paradox at its identity-protection root), and a separate one that increases productive integration once adoption happens (which experience-based scaffolding alone may not deliver).

## Relationship to Other Erosion Patterns

The paradox of expertise sits in the senior-end of the skill spectrum and is the conceptual mirror of [[novice-vulnerability]]:

| | Novices | Experts |
|---|---|---|
| Risk pattern | Over-adoption without skill formation | Under-adoption without identity update |
| Erosion mechanism | Skill-development bypass | Professional marginalization |
| Self-perception | Inflated competence (illusion) | Inflated competence (overestimation) |
| Coping (Hermann et al.) | Often dissociation/escapism | Often symbolic self-completion |

Both patterns share one root: misaligned self-assessment under GenAI-mediated work. Novices don't know they are not learning; experts don't know they are falling behind.

[Inference] If both novices and experts are vulnerable for opposite reasons, the safest stance for an organization is to assume nobody self-calibrates accurately and to design scaffolding accordingly — neither "let novices learn from AI" nor "let experts decide for themselves" is reliable.

## What It Is Not

- Not [[novice-vulnerability]]. Novice-vulnerability is over-adoption that bypasses skill formation; paradox of expertise is under-adoption that bypasses skill update. The two are mirror failures.
- Not the full [[upskilling-deskilling-paradox]]. The upskilling-deskilling paradox describes the simultaneous gain and loss of skill within an individual's GenAI use; the paradox of expertise describes the choice not to use GenAI in the first place.
- Not generic [[automation-bias]] reactance. Paradox of expertise is a specific case where the resistance is grounded in self-assessed expertise rather than in distrust of the tool.
