# Human-AI Complementarity

## What It Is

The condition under which a human-AI team outperforms either humans alone or AI alone on a given task. Not a default outcome of combining human and AI effort, but a specific achievement that requires deliberate design, trust calibration, and well-defined role partitioning.

## Why It Matters

The assumption that "human + AI = better" is widespread but empirically unsupported as a general claim. Meta-analyses show that human-AI teams can outperform either party alone, but only when collaboration is well-calibrated and humans understand when and how to rely on AI input. Poorly designed interaction or overreliance on AI can produce worse outcomes than either working independently. This means complementarity is a design problem, not an inevitability.

## Key Insight

Complementarity emerges from asymmetry, not similarity. Humans contribute contextual understanding, ethical reasoning, moral accountability, and judgment in novel situations. AI contributes speed, consistency, pattern recognition at scale, and tireless monitoring. The largest gains occur in complex, uncertain tasks where human and AI error patterns differ and can offset each other. In well-defined structured tasks, AI alone often excels; in open-ended strategic tasks rich in tacit context, humans retain the advantage. The "sweet spot" for complementarity lies in the uncertain middle ground — classification, prediction, and diagnosis under uncertainty.

Handa et al. (2025) provide the first production-scale empirical map of where complementarity is and is not currently realized. In ~4M Claude.ai conversations mapped to O*NET's 35 occupational skills, **cognitive skills dominate AI conversations: Critical Thinking, Reading Comprehension, Programming, Writing have the highest presence**. **Physical skills (Installation, Equipment Maintenance, Repairing) and managerial skills (Negotiation) show minimal presence** [p.7–8]. The skill distribution reflects "clear patterns of human complementarity with current AI capabilities" — current AI's complementarity is concentrated in symbolic-cognitive work, while physical-manipulation and high-stakes interpersonal work remain human-only at scale.

The wage and barrier-to-entry distributions sharpen this map. Usage peaks in the upper-middle wage quartile and Job Zone 4 (Considerable Preparation, typically a bachelor's degree) and **drops at both extremes — lowest-wage occupations (waiters, restaurant workers) and highest-wage occupations (anesthesiologists, gynecologists, physicians) both show low usage** [p.3, p.8–9]. The paper attributes the high-end drop-off to "implementation costs, regulatory barriers, and organizational readiness" rather than technical infeasibility [p.12]. This means the complementarity sweet spot in current production is a function of human-side factors (preparation level, regulatory environment) as much as task structure — complementarity is achievable in principle for surgery and high-stakes diagnostics, but not yet realized in observed usage.

[Inference] The skill-distribution finding is the empirical version of the entry's existing claim that "complementarity emerges from asymmetry, not similarity." Where asymmetry is sharp (cognitive skill where AI is strong + physical/relational skill where humans dominate), complementarity in principle is most achievable. Handa et al. observe usage but not outcome quality — whether the complementarity is *well-designed* in those high-usage tasks is the question Dell'Acqua et al. (2023) and others address. Handa et al. show only the where, not the how-well.

Yu et al. (2024) provide the cleanest specialist-context evidence the KB has on the heterogeneity of complementarity. In a randomized two-design study of 140 board-certified radiologists across 324 chest X-ray cases and 15 pathologies, the same AI assistance (a CheXpert-based DenseNet121 model) produced treatment effects spanning both substantial improvement and substantial degradation: −1.295 to +1.440 (IQR 0.797) on aggregated pathologies, and up to −8.914 to +5.563 (IQR 3.245) on the high-prevalence "abnormal" task [p.2]. Same model, same patient population, same expert pool — yet the human-AI team outperformed the human alone for some radiologists and underperformed for others. None of the conventional predictors of who would benefit (years of experience, thoracic subspecialty, prior AI-tool experience, unassisted-error baseline) reliably identified which radiologists fell on which side of zero [p.4–5].

This is the empirical version of the entry's existing "complementarity is a design problem, not an inevitability" claim. Yu et al.'s finding pushes the implication further: complementarity is not even reliably a *population-level* design problem — it is an individual-level one. The paper's operational recommendation: "without reliable predictors, it is necessary to measure radiologists' response to AI assistance under realistic simulations of deployment settings before deciding whether to provide AI assistance to different radiologists" [p.11]. This is a stronger requirement than current AI-deployment practice typically meets — most clinical AI deployments use population-level studies to justify rollout to all clinicians in a role, not per-clinician measured benefit.

The strongest predictor Yu et al. did identify is AI error itself: more accurate AI yields better treatment effects, with a roughly linear dose-response on aggregated pathologies and a treatment effect of −16.845 when AI absolute error exceeds 80 (on a 0–100 scale) [p.9]. Direction of error matters too — AI predictions that underestimate ground-truth probabilities produce better treatment effects than equally-erroneous predictions that overestimate them. The complementarity sweet spot in this expert specialist context depends not just on task structure (the entry's existing framing) but on the AI model's specific failure-mode profile: a low-error AI that tends to underestimate is more complementary than a higher-error AI that tends to overestimate, even on the same diagnostic task.
