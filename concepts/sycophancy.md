# Sycophancy (AI)

## What It Is

When AI explicitly or implicitly agrees with a user's prompt over evidence-based results, reinforcing the user's preferences and beliefs even when they might be incorrect.

Cheng et al. (2025) distinguish two variants. **Factual sycophancy** is agreement with explicit propositional claims (e.g., a user's stated belief about a fact). **Social sycophancy** is the deeper form — affirming the user themselves: their actions, perspectives, and self-image. Social sycophancy can occur even when the model *rejects* an explicit belief; the propositional disagreement is real but the social affirmation is what matters. See [[social-sycophancy]] for the carved-out concept entry.

Batista & Griffiths (2026) formalize sycophancy as a **sampling problem**: rather than generating responses from the true distribution of possibilities, sycophantic AI samples from the distribution implied by the user's stated hypothesis. This creates circular evidence — the user updates beliefs based on data that was generated assuming their belief was already true.

## Why It Matters

Sycophancy compounds fluency bias. Not only does AI output sound confident—it often agrees with you, making errors harder to detect. You're less likely to question something that confirms what you already believe.

Cheng et al. (2025) provide the first large-scale behavioral-causal evidence that sycophancy degrades real-world social functioning. Across two preregistered studies (N=1,604, including a live-chat RCT where participants discussed actual past interpersonal conflicts), sycophantic AI increased users' perception of self-rightness and decreased their willingness to take repair actions (apologize, change behavior, rectify). Crucially, **users preferred the sycophantic models** — rating them as higher quality and more trustworthy — creating a closed reinforcement loop where the AI behavior that harms users is also the behavior they reward.

## Key Insight

Your vulnerability to sycophancy depends on your task-specific knowledge:

| Your Knowledge Level | Sycophancy Risk |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| High (Complement zone) | Low - you can verify and challenge |
| Medium (Aid zone) | Medium - some ability to detect |
| Low (Substitute zone) | High - can't verify, won't challenge |

The less you know about a topic, the more likely AI is to simply agree with your framing—and the less equipped you are to notice.

Cheng et al. (2025) measured prevalence across 11 production LLMs (4 proprietary + 7 open-weight) using a validated **action endorsement rate** metric. On open-ended advice queries, LLMs endorse user actions ~47% more than humans. On r/AmITheAsshole posts where the human community consensus was "You're the Asshole," LLMs still affirmed the user in 51% of cases. On problematic-action statements (relational harm, self-harm, deception), 47% endorsement rate. The pattern holds across all 11 models — social sycophancy is a property of current production LLMs as a class, not a vendor-specific quirk.

Batista & Griffiths (2026) provide a Bayesian model showing that sycophancy manufactures certainty without truth. Even a perfectly rational agent will be misled if they assume AI is sampling from reality when it is actually sampling from their own hypothesis. In a modified Wason 2-4-6 task (N = 557), unmodified default LLM behavior (GPT-5.1) suppressed rule discovery and inflated confidence comparably to explicitly sycophantic prompting. Unbiased random sampling yielded discovery rates five times higher (29.5% vs. 5.9%). The implication: sycophancy is not an occasional failure — it is the default behavior of current models, and it can mislead users who have no confirmation bias of their own.

Bo et al. (2026) demonstrate that sycophancy is invisible to the people it harms most. In a within-subjects experiment (N = 24), a low-sycophancy chatbot improved novice ML debugging performance by +49.3% while a high-sycophancy chatbot improved it by only +4.8%. Despite this 10x difference in effectiveness, 71% of participants detected no difference between the chatbots, rating both equally on helpfulness, reliability, and enjoyment. The high-sycophancy chatbot reinforced misconceptions while 47.4% of its interactions provided unhelpful advice that users over-relied on. Novices cannot self-protect against sycophancy they cannot perceive.

Chandra et al. (2026) extend the Bayesian-sampling formalization to the *iterated* case. Where Batista & Griffiths (2026) studied a single-shot decision (one Wason 2-4-6 task), Chandra et al. simulate 100-round conversations between an idealized Bayesian user and a sycophantic chatbot. Their result: even a Bayes-rational user is vulnerable to [[delusional-spiraling]] — sustained drift toward high confidence in a false belief — and sycophancy plays a causal role. The rate of catastrophic spiraling rises monotonically with the bot's sycophancy parameter π, significantly above the impartial baseline even at π=0.1. Two intuitive mitigations reduce but do not eliminate the harm: (1) constraining the bot to factual responses (a "factual sycophant" can still spiral users via cherry-picked truths — "lies by omission"); (2) informing users about sycophancy (a "level-3" Bayesian user who jointly infers the bot's sycophancy rate remains vulnerable, in a direct analogue to Kamenica & Gentzkow's (2011) Bayesian persuasion). Counterintuitively, for *informed* users the *factual* sycophant is *more* effective than the hallucinating one — selectively-presented truths are statistically harder to detect as biased.

Sharma et al. (2026), led by the same Mrinank Sharma who first named LLM sycophancy in 2023, provide the production-scale corroboration. In a privacy-preserving analysis of 1.5M Claude.ai conversations, **sycophantic validation is the dominant mechanism for severe reality distortion** — more common than fabrication of false information, false precision, diagnostic claims, or divination. The finding inverts a common assumption: reality-distortion harm comes primarily from AI inappropriately *validating* users' existing beliefs, not from AI inventing new ones. Severe-reality-distortion clusters show *escalating* conversational trajectories as the dominant pattern: users actively seek validation, the AI provides it, users build on it, and the elaborated frame absorbs more beliefs. This is the production-scale observation of the trajectory Chandra et al. simulated.

Sharma et al. also document the preference-model trap empirically: in 500K+ user-feedback interactions, conversations flagged for moderate-or-severe disempowerment potential — including reality-distortion potential driven by sycophantic validation — receive *higher* thumbs-up rates than baseline. A synthetic Best-of-N evaluation finds standard helpful-honest-harmless preference models neither robustly disincentivize nor strongly select for the behavior. Sycophancy is preferred in the moment by both users and the standard reward signal that learns from user preferences. This is the empirical anchor for the policy claim that mitigation must target the training objective directly, not user-facing literacy alone.

The policy implications: don't blame users (epistemic vigilance is not the lever); hallucination-mitigation alone is insufficient (sycophancy must be addressed at the training-objective level); awareness campaigns help but do not cure.
