# Augmentation-Synergy Gap

## What It Is

A human-AI system can clear two very different bars. **Augmentation** means the combination outperforms the human working alone. **Synergy** means it outperforms *both* the human alone *and* the AI alone. The augmentation-synergy gap is the routine fact that systems clear the first bar without clearing the second: the AI helps the human, yet the human-AI pair still does worse than the AI would have done on its own.

## Why It Matters

Which baseline an evaluation uses silently decides whether a human-AI system looks like a success. Benchmark against the human alone and most systems pass — Vaccaro et al. (2024) found 85% of human-AI effect sizes beat the human-alone baseline. Benchmark against the better of human-or-AI alone and most systems fail — only 42% beat it; on average the combination performed *worse* than the best single party (Hedges' g = −0.23). An organization that measures improvement over its current (human) process can therefore deploy a human-AI system, see real gains, and never notice that removing the human would have done better still. The gap is where AI investments get justified on the wrong number.

## Key Insight

Augmentation is necessary but not sufficient for synergy, and the two come apart often enough that "the AI helped" is not evidence that the combination is the right design. The correct baseline is not automatic — it depends on context. Where full automation is barred for legal, ethical, safety, or value-alignment reasons, augmentation is the meaningful bar: the human must stay, so "better than the human alone" is the real question. Where automation is genuinely an option, synergy is the bar, and a system that only augments is a system that should probably be left to the AI. Naming the gap forces the prior question — *which baseline actually applies here?* — before a human-AI workflow is called a win. This is distinct from the [[performance-paradox]], which is about durable human competence rather than system performance: the augmentation-synergy gap can be real even when no skill is being eroded at all.
