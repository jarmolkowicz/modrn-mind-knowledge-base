## Type

Paper (longitudinal panel study, observational; four waves over 12 months; random-intercept cross-lagged panel modeling)

## Key Insight

A 12-month, four-wave longitudinal study (N = 2,149 adults across UK / US / Canada / Australia) finds bidirectional dynamics between social chatbot use and loneliness — but the pattern depends on which loneliness measure is used. With a narrow single-item *emotional isolation* measure, increased chatbot use predicted later increases in emotional isolation (β ≈ .07, p = .006) and vice versa, consistent with reciprocal exacerbation. With a broader, trait-loaded *social connection* scale, lower connection predicted later chatbot use (β ≈ −.08, p = .004) but chatbot use did not significantly predict later decreases in connection. The authors interpret this as initial evidence that loneliness may spur chatbot use *and* that such use may, over time, exacerbate feelings of loneliness — while explicitly cautioning against strong causal conclusions.

## Key Findings

**Sample and design**
- N = 2,149 adults from UK (50%), US (28%), Canada (14%), Australia (8%); mean age 40.0 years; 49% male.
- Four surveys at 4-month intervals, total span 12 months (Wave 1: Nov 2023 – Feb 2024; Wave 4: Nov 2024 – Feb 2025).
- 46% completed all four waves; 14% completed only one. All retained to maximize precision in RI-CLPM estimation.
- Recruited via Prolific Academic; sample acknowledged as more technologically savvy than the broader Western adult population.

**Frequency of social chatbot use**
- 26–30% of participants reported any social chatbot use in a given 4-month window across waves; ~70–74% reported "never."
- Modal use among users was "a few times" over 4 months. Daily use was 1% across all waves.
- No significant change in mean use across waves (M_W1 = 1.60 to M_W4 = 1.69; p = .96).

**RI-CLPM with emotional isolation measure (single-item Gallup-style)**
- Increased chatbot use → increased emotional isolation 4 months later: β = .06–.08, p = .006.
- Increased emotional isolation → increased chatbot use 4 months later: β ≈ .06, p = .023.
- Stable between-person correlation: r = .13, p < .001 (people who typically feel isolated also use social chatbots more in general).
- Model fit: CFI = .964, RMSEA = .032, SRMR = .045.
- 70–73% of variance in emotional isolation was between-person (stable) at any given wave.

**RI-CLPM with social connection measure (20-item Lee et al. 2001 scale)**
- Lower social connection → increased chatbot use 4 months later: β ≈ −.07 to −.09, p = .004.
- Increased chatbot use → decreased social connection 4 months later: β ≈ −.02 to −.03, p = .369 (in expected direction but not significant).
- 85–89% of variance in social connection was between-person (highly trait-loaded), limiting sensitivity to within-person change.
- Model fit: CFI = .975, RMSEA = .032, SRMR = .043.

**Robustness checks**
- Six alternative analyses run per measure: removing the 567 participants who had a prior ChatGPT exposure experiment; listwise deletion (n = 970); only participants with chatbot-use variation (n = 766); robust standard errors; without social-stressor controls; quadrivariate RI-CLPM adding perceived support and number of close friends.
- Chatbot use → subsequent emotional isolation was significant in 5/6 analyses (sixth marginal at p = .069).
- Social connection → subsequent chatbot use was significant in 5/6 analyses (sixth marginal at p = .054).
- Quadrivariate model: chatbot use did not predict changes in perceived support or close friends (ps > .322), suggesting these constructs are not substantial confounders or mediators.

**Causal-inference caveats (the authors' own)**
- Study was not preregistered; authors explicitly label findings exploratory and warn that p values would not survive multiple-comparisons corrections.
- RI-CLPM cross-lagged effects imply causality only if positivity, exchangeability, and consistency hold; the authors argue they only partially satisfy these. Hidden confounders (e.g., asking a chatbot about a job offer, then taking the new job, which independently increases loneliness) cannot be excluded.
- Effect sizes are small (standardized β ≈ .06–.09).

## Why the Two Measures Diverge

The authors' own interpretation: the emotional isolation single item has high face validity for the within-person construct of "feeling lonely right now"; the 20-item social connection scale has more items (less noise) but assesses a more stable identity ("I see myself as a loner," "I am in tune with the world"), so 85–89% of its variance is between-person. The narrower measure picks up small within-person fluctuations driven by chatbot use; the broader trait-like measure does not. Reductions in stable social identity may instead trigger people to seek out AI as a behavioral compensation. Both readings are exploratory.

## Relevance

Three load-bearing contributions:

- **Adds a longitudinal observational leg to the [[ai-loneliness-effect]] evidence base.** [[fang-ai-loneliness-2025]] is a 4-week engineered RCT; [[sharma-disempowerment-patterns-2026]] is a production-data cross-section. Folk-Dunn fills the gap between these — months-scale, in-the-wild, with temporal precedence.
- **Sharpens [[mira-model]] principle 4 (relational substitution vs. enhancement).** The bidirectional finding on the emotional-isolation measure is consistent with the substitution arm: chatbots may serve as low-cost compensation for missing human contact and, over months, displace rather than supplement it.
- **Strengthens the friction-erosion pathway in [[social-friction]].** Folk-Dunn highlights that chatbot relationships lack reciprocal disclosure — a key ingredient of rewarding human relationships — and that initial emotional rewards may grow stale. This complements Perry's argument about social friction by adding the longitudinal substitution mechanism.

## Supports

- [[ai-loneliness-effect]] — adds longitudinal observational evidence (12-month, 4-country, N=2,149) of bidirectional loneliness ↔ chatbot use dynamics with the narrower emotional-isolation measure.
- [[fang-ai-loneliness-2025]] — complements with a longer time horizon and a real-world (rather than randomized) chatbot-exposure design; same direction of effect at the population level.
- [[mira-model]] — empirical evidence consistent with MIRA's substitution arm in principle 4 (relational substitution vs. enhancement).
- [[boyd-markowitz-human-connection-2026]] — already cites Folk-Dunn as part of the empirical loneliness literature MIRA frames.
- [[social-friction]] — supports the substitution-displacement mechanism that compounds the friction-erosion pathway Perry articulates.
- [[capacity-erosion]] — relational-skill register: time spent with always-available chatbots may displace the unpredictable human interactions through which relationship capacities develop.

## Contradicts / Extends

- Extends short-window experimental work (De Freitas et al., 2024; Drouin et al., 2022; Folk et al., 2024; Ho et al., 2018) showing immediate mood and loneliness benefits from chatbot interactions. Folk-Dunn argues those short-term benefits may belie longer-term costs that only become visible at the months-scale.
- Consistent in direction with [[fang-ai-loneliness-2025]]'s dose-dependent finding that higher daily usage correlates with more loneliness; differs in design (longitudinal observational vs. RCT) and time horizon (12 months vs. 4 weeks).

## Open Questions

- Causal direction is partially identified at best. The authors recommend daily diary studies that randomly assign participants to chatbot interaction to test whether texting with a chatbot displaces interactions with friends.
- Whether the bidirectional finding is specific to social chatbot use, or generalizes to other AI-assisted compensatory behavior (e.g., turning to AI for advice in lieu of human counsel).
- Whether engineered chatbot characteristics (voice vs. text, modality, personality) moderate the long-term substitution effect — this study collapsed across all chatbot types.
- Whether the divergence between emotional-isolation and social-connection measures reflects measurement artifact or a substantive distinction (small behavioral changes shifting feelings without altering stable self-image).
- Whether effects of similar magnitude appear in non-Western samples; the four-country sample is entirely Anglophone Western.
