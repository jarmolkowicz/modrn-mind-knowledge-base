## 2026-04-29T23:15:00Z - triaged: DEFER
- Chandra, Kleiman-Weiner, Ragan-Kelley & Tenenbaum (MIT) - sycophantic chatbots cause delusional spiraling. High-priority for next session.

## 2026-04-30 — re-triaged: INCLUDE
- Re-triggered for Pass-3 batch ingest. Override prior DEFER per orchestrator instruction. Full Stage-2 triage written. Auto-decided INCLUDE per librarian rubric (Relevance=HIGH, Quality=HIGH, not a duplicate).
- Plan: source distillation + 1 NEW concept (`delusional-spiraling`) + UPDATEs to [[sycophancy]], [[borrowed-certainty]], [[belief-offloading]].

## 2026-04-30 — drafted
- drafts/source.md (source distillation, follows tooling/templates/source.md)
- drafts/concepts/delusional-spiraling.md (NEW concept; status: emerging)
- drafts/updates/sycophancy.md, drafts/updates/borrowed-certainty.md, drafts/updates/belief-offloading.md (UPDATE proposals)
- distill.md ledger written; Decision: PROCEED_TO_CRITIQUE (NEW concept warrants adversarial scrutiny vs adjacent entries).

## 2026-04-30 — critiqued
- critique.md written: 3 lenses (Evidence/Practitioner/Adversarial) + AI failure checklist run on all 5 drafts.
- Overall: READY. NEW concept delusional-spiraling confirmed novel (not a relabel of borrowed-certainty/belief-offloading; the trajectory framing is structurally distinct).
- One minor revision applied: [Inference] tag added to interpretive sentence in drafts/updates/borrowed-certainty.md.
- Decision: PROCEED_TO_INTEGRATE. Stage 4.5 validation runs next.

## 2026-04-30 — validated
- validate_drafts.py exit 0; 0 findings. All checks pass (broken_wikilinks, alias_form, missing_related, frontmatter, slug_year_mismatch, key_passages_missing).
- Decision: PROCEED_TO_INTEGRATE.

## 2026-04-30 — integrated
- drafts/source.md → sources/chandra-sycophantic-delusional-2026.md
- drafts/concepts/delusional-spiraling.md → concepts/delusional-spiraling.md (NEW; status: emerging; area: risk, erosion)
- UPDATE applied to concepts/sycophancy.md (frontmatter source added; "Chandra et al. (2026)" body paragraph + policy implications; Related: [[delusional-spiraling]]; Sources: [[chandra-sycophantic-delusional-2026]])
- UPDATE applied to concepts/borrowed-certainty.md (frontmatter source added; new "Compounding Across Rounds" section; Related and Sources updated; one [Inference] tag preserved per critique guidance)
- UPDATE applied to concepts/belief-offloading.md (frontmatter source added; new "Persistence Under Awareness" section; Related and Sources updated)
- Auxiliary scripts: sync-source-links.py (normalized citation strings in concept frontmatter), build-index.py (index.md regenerated), update_readme_counts.py (52→53 concepts, 59→60 sources, 122→124 total)
- KB-root log.md appended
- drafts/concepts/ removed (empty); drafts/updates/ retained as evidence
- Re-validation clean post-integration.
