## 2026-04-30 — renamed + reclassified
- Slug renamed from `artificial-intelligence-and-illusions-of-understanding-in-scientific-research` to `messeri-crockett-illusions-understanding-2024` (canonical author-keyword-year form).
- Source type reclassified from `article` to `paper` (Nature Perspective, peer-reviewed, doi:10.1038/s41586-024-07146-0).

## 2026-04-30 — triaged
- Decision: INCLUDE (AUTO).
- Relevance=HIGH, Quality=HIGH; not a duplicate of any existing entry.
- Extractable: 3 NEW concept candidates (`illusion-of-exploratory-breadth`, `illusion-of-objectivity`, `scientific-monoculture`), 1 NEW foundational concept (`illusion-of-explanatory-depth`), 1 NEW method (`ai-vision-taxonomy`), and UPDATE proposals to `confidence-competence-gap`, `borrowed-certainty`, `artificial-certainty`, `fluency-bias`, `metacognition`, `creativity-diversity-paradox`.

## 2026-04-30 — drafted
- Decision: PROCEED_TO_CRITIQUE (volume of new entries + paper-original constructs warrant Stage 4 review).
- Files: drafts/source.md; drafts/concepts/{illusion-of-explanatory-depth, illusion-of-exploratory-breadth, illusion-of-objectivity, scientific-monoculture}.md; drafts/methods/ai-vision-taxonomy.md; drafts/updates/{confidence-competence-gap, borrowed-certainty, artificial-certainty, fluency-bias, creativity-diversity-paradox}.md.

## 2026-04-30 — critiqued
- Overall: READY.
- All drafts passed Evidence, Practitioner, and Adversarial lenses + AI failure checklist.
- Decision: PROCEED_TO_INTEGRATE.

## 2026-04-30 — validated
