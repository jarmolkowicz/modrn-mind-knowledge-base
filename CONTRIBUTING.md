## Submit a PR

Collaborators with write access push a branch directly. External contributors fork the repo and PR upstream.

For entry structure, see `tooling/templates/`. The templates define the schema, the section layout, and what each entry type (concept, method, source) is for.

## What's a good fit

- Research papers with clear implications for human thinking with AI
- Methods or frameworks from domain experts
- Practitioner observations grounded in evidence
- Corrections or clarifications to existing entries

## What's not a fit

- Opinion without evidence
- Content outside the "human thinking with AI" domain (e.g., general AI capabilities, AI safety alignment)
- Duplicates of existing concepts — check `index.md` first

## Going deeper

If you have write access and use Claude Code, ingestion is driven by a single slash command: `/ingest <path>` (HITL) or `/ingest <path> --auto`. The librarian agent at `.claude/agents/librarian.md` walks the source through five stages — catalog, triage, distill, self-critique, integrate — keeping the full audit trail in `raw/<slug>/`. See `CLAUDE.md` for the operating model.
