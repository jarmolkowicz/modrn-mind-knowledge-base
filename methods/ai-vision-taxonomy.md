# AI Vision Taxonomy (Oracle / Surrogate / Quant / Arbiter)

## Overview

A four-part taxonomy of how AI tools are positioned as collaborators in knowledge work, developed by Messeri & Crockett (2024) for the scientific research pipeline. Each vision identifies a distinct cognitive limit it promises to overcome, and each carries a distinct profile of epistemic risk. The diagnostic move is simple but powerful: before adopting an AI tool, name which vision it is invoking. The vision determines which illusions of understanding the use is most exposed to.

The taxonomy was developed for science but generalizes naturally to consulting, analysis, journalism, and other knowledge work.

## What It Is / How It Works

Messeri & Crockett (2024, Table 1) map the four visions to research-pipeline stages:

| Vision | Stage | Limits AI promises to overcome | What the vision is |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Oracle** | Study design / hypothesis generation | Too much literature; uneven quality; reader bias | Tools that search, evaluate, summarize literature and generate hypotheses |
| **Surrogate** | Data collection | Data are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain | Tools that generate surrogate data points (incl. synthetic human participants) |
| **Quant** | Data analysis | Data are too large or complex to curate and analyse | Tools that analyse vast and complex datasets, sometimes producing patterns inaccessible to human minds |
| **Arbiter** | Peer review / quality judgement | Too many submissions; reviewer bias; reproducibility crisis | Tools that evaluate scientific merit and predict replicability |

The visions reinforce each other. Surrogate-generated data needs Quant analysis. Quant outputs and Surrogate datasets generate more publications for Arbiters to evaluate and Oracles to summarize. All four visions converge on two promises: **productivity** (overcoming time/attention/cognitive limits) and **objectivity** (overcoming subjectivity and bias).

## Risk Profile by Vision

Each vision has a characteristic relationship to the three illusions of understanding (Messeri & Crockett 2024):

- **Oracle** loads heavily on the [[illusion-of-objectivity]] (it is described as bias-free literature evaluation) and contributes to the [[illusion-of-exploratory-breadth]] (its summaries shape which hypotheses get pursued).
- **Surrogate** loads heavily on the [[illusion-of-objectivity]] (synthetic participants are framed as representing all humanity) and on the [[illusion-of-exploratory-breadth]] (only quantifiable, AI-tractable phenomena get studied).
- **Quant** loads heavily on the [[illusion-of-explanatory-depth]] (predictive accuracy is mistaken for understanding of mechanism — the prediction–explanation fallacy).
- **Arbiter** loads heavily on the [[illusion-of-objectivity]] (AI peer review is framed as removing human subjectivity, but embeds the standpoints of its training data).

## What To Do

A diagnostic protocol, adapted from Messeri & Crockett's prescription "be clear about why you want to use AI in your research":

1. **Name the vision.** Before adopting an AI tool, ask: am I treating this as Oracle, Surrogate, Quant, or Arbiter? More than one is possible; name each.
2. **Read the risk profile.** Each vision corresponds to specific illusions of understanding. Make those risks explicit before they start operating implicitly.
3. **Check the productivity-vs-understanding trade.** The vision is appealing because it overcomes a cognitive or material limit. Is the limit one you want overcome here, or is it doing protective work (forcing you to read the literature carefully, collect data attentively, etc.)?
4. **Check the objectivity framing.** All four visions claim to remove human bias. Whose standpoints does the tool actually embed? Whose are filtered out?
5. **Identify lower-risk uses.** Routine tasks (composing emails) and tasks within your own expertise (writing code you could write yourself, given enough time) carry less epistemic risk than tasks outside your expertise.
6. **Maintain non-AI tracks.** For high-stakes work, keep at least one method running that does not depend on the same AI toolchain — for triangulation, not just corroboration.

## Why It Works

The taxonomy works because the visions are *not* tools — they are sociotechnical framings about what AI is *for*. Naming the framing makes the embedded promise visible, and once the promise is visible the corresponding risk profile becomes legible.

Messeri & Crockett (2024, Box 2) note that "AI is not a monolith." Treating "AI use" as a single category obscures the very different epistemic risks of, say, an Oracle that summarizes literature versus a Surrogate that simulates participants. The taxonomy is designed to break that monolith into useful pieces.

## Strengths / Limitations

**Strengths:**
- Concise. Four categories, mapped to research-pipeline stages.
- Generalizable. The categories translate naturally to consulting (Oracle = research summarizer; Surrogate = synthetic personas; Quant = analyst; Arbiter = quality judge).
- Couples each vision to specific epistemic risks rather than treating "AI risk" as a single bucket.
- Makes the productivity/objectivity dual promise visible and questionable.

**Limitations:**
- The taxonomy is descriptive of current visions; AI capabilities evolve, and new visions may emerge.
- The categories overlap in practice. A single AI use often invokes more than one vision (e.g. an LLM that summarizes literature *and* writes code is Oracle + Quant).
- Does not provide a quantitative risk weighting; it is a diagnostic, not a metric.
- [Inference] The taxonomy may understate risks specific to LLMs as conversational interfaces — sycophancy, persuasion dynamics, and mode collapse are not cleanly mapped to any single vision.

## When It Applies

Use this method whenever you are deciding whether or how to adopt an AI tool in knowledge work — research, consulting, analysis, writing, decision-making — and want a fast way to name the trade-offs. It is most useful at the *adoption* stage; once a tool is embedded in a workflow, the framing tends to become invisible and the risks harder to surface.

When NOT to use this: for purely procedural AI uses (formatting, transcription) the taxonomy adds friction without insight. The visions become useful when the AI is being asked to participate in *judgement*, not just execution.
