# Reflective-Inquiry Design

## Overview

A framework for **educators and tool designers** (not individual users) to protect and foster reflective — i.e. critical — thinking in AI-mediated learning. It repurposes John Dewey's prerequisites for reflective thought as a *dual* instrument: a **diagnostic** (an AI-mediated interaction is "passive" to the degree those prerequisites go unmet) and a **design lens** (each unmet prerequisite names an intervention to build back in). Proposed by Singh et al. (2025), building on Dewey's *How We Think* (1910) and Krathwohl's revised Bloom's Taxonomy.

## What It Is / How It Works

Dewey identifies four types of thought — mere awareness, imaginative thought, belief (examined or not), and **reflective thought** (conscious evaluation of evidence), the last being most essential for deep learning. Reflective thought has five **prerequisites**, and GenAI has a characteristic way of undermining each — this pairing is the diagnostic map:

| Reflective-thinking prerequisite | How GenAI tends to undermine it |
|---|---|
| A state of perplexity, confusion, or doubt that prompts inquiry | Immediate synthesized answers dissolve the productive doubt after the first question |
| Prior experience and knowledge to draw on | Instant synthesis lets novices bypass the knowledge-building climb (the Bloom's-ladder skip) |
| Active, persistent consideration of ideas | Belief-aligned, socially-desirable responses discourage engaging opposing views |
| Suspended judgment + tolerance for uncertainty | Confident, uncertainty-free output raises persuasiveness and short-circuits judgment |
| Ability to connect and evaluate related ideas | Coherent structure manufactures an illusion of comprehensive understanding over a shallow grasp |

## What To Do

**Diagnose (spot passive AI use).** For a given learning interaction, ask which prerequisites are going unmet: Was there real doubt, or did the learner accept the first synthesized answer? Did they encounter anything that challenged their priors? Did they suspend judgment, or defer to confident output? Did they connect the output to prior knowledge and evaluate it? Unmet prerequisites are the signal.

**Design (build the prerequisites back in), keyed to each gap:**

1. **Restore productive doubt.** Require learners to highlight and interrogate parts of an AI response before they can use it; inject small amounts of "desirable friction" ahead of consuming outputs (→ [[cognitive-friction]], [[desirable-difficulty]]).
2. **Protect the knowledge-building climb.** Keep AI *minimal in early learning* — formative feedback only — and use staged guardrails that increase learner-AI interaction gradually as competence grows (→ [[zone-of-proximal-development]], [[novice-vulnerability]]).
3. **Sustain persistent consideration and idea-connection.** Provide schema-based tools (e.g. a navigable knowledge graph beside a conversational agent) that surface relevant prior-knowledge schemas so learners link new information to what they already know.
4. **Reinstate suspended judgment.** Use metacognitive prompts that pause learners at critical moments to consider alternatives or assess their own comprehension; use AI-generated "provocations" that surface the risks, biases, limitations, and alternatives to a recommendation.
5. **Shift what gets assessed.** Emphasize critical and evaluative skills in curricula and high-stakes tests (which currently reward the formulaic skills AI already does well), and make *critiquing AI outputs* a graded learning activity.

## Why It Works

The framework rests on well-supported cognitive-science mechanisms even though the framework itself is untested: cognitive difficulty triggers analytical reasoning ([[desirable-difficulty]]); metacognitive skill is built by practising the cognitive operations AI offloads ([[metacognition]], [[cognitive-offloading]], [[metacognitive-laziness]]); friction slows automatic acceptance ([[cognitive-friction]]). Its staged-guardrail principle converges with empirical results that constraining or reducing AI in learning protects capability ([[bastani-guardrails-math-rct-2025]], [[passalacqua-less-ai-2024]]).

## Strengths / Limitations

**Strengths:**
- Gives designers a principled, prerequisite-by-prerequisite vocabulary rather than generic "add friction" advice.
- Operates at the environment/tool level, complementing individual practices ([[think-first]], [[socratic-partnership]]) rather than duplicating them.
- Bridges established learning theory (Dewey, Bloom) to concrete AI-tool design choices.

**Limitations:**
- `status: speculative` — a workshop proposal; the interventions are illustrative and have not been evaluated as a package.
- Harm-focused by design; it does not weigh interaction modes where AI *aids* reflection, so it can over-restrict.
- Assumes reflective thinking is the right target and that unmet prerequisites reliably indicate passivity — both plausible but unvalidated.
- Novice-oriented; the shift point from "minimal AI" to "collaborative AI" along a learning trajectory is left unspecified.

## When It Applies

For educators, curriculum/test designers, and builders of educational AI tools — especially where learners are novices still forming the skills at stake. It is an environmental complement to, not a replacement for, individual-practice methods. Do **not** apply its "minimize AI" default to expert workflows, where AI offloading of lower-level tasks can enhance rather than erode performance.
